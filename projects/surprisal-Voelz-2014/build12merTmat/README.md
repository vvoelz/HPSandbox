## Description

These scripts construct and analyze a Markov Model transition matrix for 12-mer HP sequence.
The MSM transition matrix can then be reweighted to predcit the effects of sequence mutations on
folding stability and dynamics.  The results were presented in Voelz et al. (2014).


## Requirements

MSMbuilder python library: http://msmbuilder.org/3.8.0/
