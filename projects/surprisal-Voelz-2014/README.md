# Markov Models of lattice protein dynamics

The following projects are related to work presented in Voelz et al 2014, in which a
Markov Model of folding is constructed for the 12-mer sequence HPHPHPHPPHPH.  This work
uses a more sophisticated energy function with adjustable protein-like interaction
strengths.
