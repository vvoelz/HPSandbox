# Projects using HPSandbox

Here you will find several coding projects that use the HPSandbox data structures
to perform various calculations

* enumerate12 - Description
* mcrex12 - Descvriptio
* testing
* toy12mer


The following projects are related to work presented in Voelz et al 2014, in which a
Markov Model of folding is constructed for the 12-mer sequence HPHPHPHPPHPH.  This work
uses a more sophisticated energy function with adjustable and protein-like interaction
strengths.

* build12merTmat
* sampleCounts
* sequenceDesignS
