# Projects using HPSandbox

Here you will find several coding projects that use the HPSandbox data structures
to perform various calculations.

* [enumerate12](https://github.com/vvoelz/HPSandbox/tree/2-update-to-python-3/projects/enumerate12) - Exhaustive enumeration of all chain conformations

* [mcrex12](https://github.com/vvoelz/HPSandbox/tree/2-update-to-python-3/projects/mcrex12) - Monte Carlo sampling of lattice protein conformations with Replica Exchange


* [surprisal-Voelz-2014](https://github.com/vvoelz/HPSandbox/tree/2-update-to-python-3/projects/surprisal-Voelz-2014) - Markov Models of lattice protein folding dynamics, and sequence perturbations of them
